"# COVID-Detection-DenseNet201" 

The Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an extremely contagious and rapidly spreading 
disease, therefore early diagnosis is of utmost importance. Recognizing the problem of not 
having an effective tool, in addition to tests to aid in detection, this was the reason for proposing
this work.
This research focuses on evaluating the effectiveness of a Deep Learning-based classification 
model for the detection of COVID-19, with the aim of determining how effective and efficient 
the proposed model is for virus detection, using chest X-ray images. For this purpose, three 
public datasets were used (COVID Chest X-ray Dataset, COVID Chest X-ray Dataset, and 
COVID-19 Radiography Database).
To carry out the research, various pre-trained models based on the DenseNet architecture are 
used, and a modification is proposed in the DenseNet201 architecture where a modification is 
made in the first phase of convolution and in the "Transition Layers". This model, in turn, uses 
transfer learning using the ImageNet Dataset. The results show that the proposed model has an 
effectiveness of 98%, with an efficiency of 18.1M params and 3.2GFLOPs, surpassing other 
state-of-the-art proposals. It is concluded that the proposed model is reliable, effective, and 
low-cost for the detection of COVID-19.
